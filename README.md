# ⭐ Funkybot

## Inspiration

As a frequent Discord user, I have used countless bots with a million different commands. However, I got tired of needing five different bots to do six things, or
being limited to certain features unless I paid a subscription for premium. As such, I created my own Discord bot to perform the functions I needed.

Funkybot is vaguely themed around my favourite character from the game Genshin Impact: Venti!

## Things I Learnt

To get started, I followed a tutorial by freeCodeCamp. However, some information was outdated, and they only provided walkthroughs for very basic functions.
I did a lot of research to add other features to Funkybot, and I slowly became comfortable with the discord.py library, as well as others such as datetime.

Funkybot is currently hosted with UptimeRobot and a Python script that uses Flask. This was my first time using Flask, so it was cool to see what it could do.
Moreover, this was my first time hosting something that I created online — I hadn't even put up a website before. As such, I was amazed at how simple it was,
and this encouraged me for future projects!

## Next Steps

There are some other commands I'd like to implement, such as searching the internet and grabbing information about various things (for example, Genshin Impact).
Additionally, I've been wondering whether or not I can clean up the main Python file, and move some code into a different file that I import in.
This would be useful for things such as people's birthdays.
